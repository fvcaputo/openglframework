- Need to keep in mind certain things when dealing with changing variables on OpenGL shaders.
For instance, changing mat4 to mat3, example:

vec3 vPosition;
mat4 modelView;

-> WRONG: 
   vec4 posEyeCoord = mat3(modelView) * vPosition; 
   Keep in mind how OpenGL deals with matrixes (column major or row major). If you do this it will mess
   up the calculations because of the matrix

-> CORRECT:
   vec4 posEyeCoord = modelView * vec4(vPosition, 1.0);
   posEyeCoord.xyz
   This would be the correct way to have the calculation occur, and the after that you just need to remember
   to use ".xyz" to deal with the new variable.

- DO NOT use this to multiplicate vectors (i.e., make "matrices" with one row and 5 columns). It will not work
  and it also will not give any compilers erros.
